        <summary>Summary</summary>
        <p>At Third & Grove I was tasked with the challenge of optimizing the website experience of one of its major retainer accounts, SunPower.com. As the Design Lead on this project, I collaborated closely with the Director of Strategy, Mark Lavoritano, to conduct an in-depth analysis, identify opportunities for improvement, and implement a comprehensive solution tailored to meet SunPower's business requirements and SEO/marketing goals.</p>

        <summary>Problem</summary>
        <p>The primary objectives for SunPower.com were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Optimizing Lead Generation:</strong> To enhance lead generation and conversion rates, the website needed to outperform its key competitor, Tesla's solar panel offerings.</li>
          <li><strong>Simplifying Complex Product Offerings:</strong> SunPower's product offerings were intricate, and the challenge was to communicate the superiority of their offerings over competitors in a clear and compelling manner.</li>
          <li><strong>Boosting Partner Engagement:</strong> The website aimed to strengthen partnerships by instilling confidence in SunPower's supply chain and empowering partners, dealers, and developers with personalized portals.</li>
        </ul>

        <summary>Solution</summary>
        <p>To tackle the challenges effectively, the following solution was devised:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>SEO-Driven Enhancements: </strong> Insights from third-party SEO vendor, <a href="https://www.33sticks.com/" target="_blank">33 Sticks</a>, were translated into actionable improvements for the design system, theme, and website features. These enhancements were aligned with SEO best practices and SunPower's marketing objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>User-Centric Design and Prototyping:</strong> Multiple versions of the website were ideated, designed, and prototyped for live user testing. This iterative approach allowed for fine-tuning the user experience, boosting partnership integrations, and optimizing lead generation.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>In-medium Design Deliverables:</strong> As part of the typical design process I established at Third & Grove, this project included in-medium design deliverables (creative designed and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). Not only did this allow for all stakeholders — no matter technical skills or knowledge — to review creative immediately, it also served as more definitive and granular development materials
