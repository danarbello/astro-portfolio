        <p>Nothing is transparent: all development is quiet and locked behind corporate doors. If you aren't a <strong>webmaster</strong> or working on the engineering team of one of these companies then you've no idea what is going on behind the code.</p>

        <hr class="light">
        <p>How web software is made, tweaked, and maintained nowadays:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working privately</strong> at a company like OpenAI and Meta (Facebook, Instagram, Threads, etc.)</li>
          <li><strong>Contributing to open source</strong>: like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, WordPress, and creative commons.</li>
          <li><strong>Contributing to languages and standards</strong> like HTML, CSS are not licensed or licenseable.</li>
          <li><strong>Contributing to working groups</strong>: Collection of people that regularly maintain standards, languages, and softwares for public use like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        </ul>

        <Image src={classImage7} alt="W3C logo" />
        <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> maintains and upgrades internet software.</p>

        <hr class="light">
        <p>It's <em>systems</em> all the way down.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Development operations (devOps)</strong>: Where code is launched and kept stable on the internet, like the process of getting into and riding the car or bus that brings you to school</li>
          <li><strong>Back-end</strong>: Where code builds the core of websites, like the bones and organs in your body</li>
          <li><strong>Front-end</strong>: Where code structures and styles what you see, like your hair, skin, clothing, and makeup</li>
          <li><strong>Content</strong>: Where all the data and rules stem from, like the ideas in your brain and the words it speaks out into the world</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Management systems make up the vast majority of the internet nowadays.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Content Management System (CMS)</strong>: Stores and publishes any kind of data desired in a reusable and redeployable fasion. Think news or blog website.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Asset Management (DAM)</strong>: Stores massive troves of images, texts, and variants of those. Think library but on the internet.</li>
          <li><strong>Product Information Management (PIM)</strong>: Just like a DAM but stores information and content about products. Think store library but on the internet and locked away.</li>
          <li><strong>Customer Relationship Management (CRM)</strong>: Stores information about real humans and the companies they work for for marketing and advertising purposes. Think like a super secret address book.</li>
          <li><strong>Digital Experience Platform (DXP)</strong>: Compiles all of the above services into a massive monolith of content management and publishing. Think like a machine wired up to every and anything that is connected to the internet.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr class="light">
        <p>Bonus stuff:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Virtual Private Network: A way to hide where exactly you are accessing the internet from.</li>
          <li>Search is dead: What are algorithms and how content is spoon-fed to users nowadays?</li>
          <li>The difference between algorithms, search configuration, AI, and AGI</li>
          <li>How do websites that don't sell anything make money?</li>
        </ul>
